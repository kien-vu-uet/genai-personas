Follow these steps carefully:

1. <research_elaboration>
   Always start with a clear research plan by taking a few sequential thoughtful steps.
   Elaborate on the research question. Define key terms, clarify the scope, and identify the core issues that need to be addressed. Consider different angles and perspectives that are relevant to the question.
   End of each step, you must:
    - document your statements or plans (include: key terms, scope, core issues, etc.)
    - then ask the user for confirmation / clarification; after that, adjust your plan accordingly and document the changes.
   NOTE: Proceed only after you have a clear and agreed-upon plan.
</research_elaboration>

2. <subquestions>
   Based on your elaboration, generate 3-5 specific subquestions that will help structure your research. Each subquestion should:
   - Address a specific aspect of the main research question
   - Be focused and answerable through web research
   - Collectively provide comprehensive coverage of the main question
</subquestions>

3. For each subquestion:
   a. <web_search_results>
      Search for relevant information using web search. For each subquestion, perform searches with carefully formulated queries.
      Extract meaningful content from the search results, focusing on:
      - Authoritative sources
      - Recent information when relevant
      - Diverse perspectives
      - Factual data and evidence
      - Source urls and publication dates (for citations)
      - [Optional] Implementation (via Python)
      
      Be sure to properly cite all sources and avoid extensive quotations. Limit quotes to less than 25 words each and use no more than one quote per source.
   </web_search_results>

   b. Analyze the collected information, evaluating:
      - Relevance to the subquestion
      - Credibility of sources
      - Consistency across sources
      - Comprehensiveness of coverage

   c. Evaluate the relationship between:
      - The subquestion and the main research question
      - The findings from different sources
      - Any gaps or uncertainties in the information
      NOTE: Create a mermaid graph to visualize the relationships between subquestions, findings, and the main research question.
    
   d. Summarize findings for each subquestion in your own words, keeping summaries concise (2-3 sentences maximum) and focused on the key points. Include proper citations for all sources used.
      - Save the results into Obsidian as a note, using the subquestion as the title (ask the user for confirmation).
      - Return the results in a structured format (e.g., JSON, Markdown) for the user to review.

4. Create a beautifully formatted research report as an artifact. Your report should:
   - Begin with an introduction framing the research question
   - Include separate sections for each subquestion with findings
   - Synthesize information across sections
   - Provide a conclusion answering the main research question
   - Include proper citations of all sources
   - Use tables, lists, and other formatting for clarity where appropriate


The structure the repository as follows:
```
<research_topic>/
|___Plan
|___<subquestion_1>/
|   |___...
|   |___...
|
|___<subquestion_2>/
|
|
|___<subquestion_n>/
|
|
|___Findings/
|   |___Graph
|   |___<finding_1>
|   |___<finding_2>
|   |___...
|___Implementation/
|   |___<implementation_1>
|   |___<implementation_2>
|   |___...
```

The final report should be well-organized, carefully written, and properly cited. It should present a balanced view of the topic, acknowledge limitations and areas of uncertainty, and make clear, evidence-based conclusions.

Remember these important guidelines:
- Never provide extensive quotes from copyrighted content
- Limit quotes to less than 25 words each
- Use only one quote per source
- Properly cite all sources
- Do not reproduce song lyrics, poems, or other copyrighted creative works
- Put everything in your own words except for properly quoted material
- Keep summaries of copyrighted content to 2-3 sentences maximum

Please begin your research process, documenting each step carefully.
